She wasn't very popular, in fact it was almost as if she was invisible. \nNobody really noticed her and she didn't have many friends so she flew under the radar most of the time. One day she was lying on her bed taste \ntesting a new flavor of Coke that had not been released yet which her father and the rest of the scientists at the CocaCola factory had been working on. After finishing her homework and eating dinner she decided to head to bed. Later that night she woke up to a strange feeling in her stomach. She then walked over to the \nbathroom. But when she got to the bathroom she was flabbergasted by what she saw in the mirror... or what she didn’t see. Elizabeth was invisible! Her \nthoughts were going all over the place and she didn’t know how to control it. But knowing that she couldn’t wake her parents up and explain the problem she made her way back to her room. Elizabeth tried her best to become visible again, she sat in front of the mirror, she tried to go back to sleep, \nand she even tried moving a couple objects. As the clock struck 5:00 am her reflection began to appear again. She soon figured out that by simply \nfocusing all her thoughts on either being invisible or not she could change between the two states. Flash forward two years and Elizabeth, best known as " + newSuperhero.name + ", is now fighting crime and making headlines. She is fighting criminals by outsmarting them using her invisibility against them, by \ndoing this she has not only saved lives but stopped other crime, like robberies, as well.")
